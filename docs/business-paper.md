## Executive Summary

Selendra Network is positioned as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain built on Substrate with AlephBFT consensus for finality and Proof-of-Stake security model. With an annual inflation rate of 21,000,000 SEL tokens, Selendra aims to serve both business and general users across multiple use cases, with particular focus on DeFi, Real World Assets (RWA), and Loyalty programs.

This document outlines a comprehensive, strategic product roadmap spanning 36 months. Our approach prioritizes robust infrastructure development, seamless business integration capabilities, and a phased introduction of specialized products that address specific industry needs. The roadmap is designed to create a sustainable ecosystem that maximizes SEL token utility while delivering tangible value to enterprise and individual users alike.

## Market Analysis and Opportunity

The blockchain industry continues to mature, with adoption increasingly driven by practical use cases rather than speculation. Enterprise adoption remains a significant growth frontier, with key drivers including:
