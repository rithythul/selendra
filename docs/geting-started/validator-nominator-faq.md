# Validators & Nominators

## Who can be an Selendra validator?
Anyone who covers the minimum hardware and staking amount requirements can become a validator on Selendra.

## What are the requirements for running a validator node on Selendra?
- CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz
- Storage - An NVMe solid state drive of 1 TB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth).
- Memory - 64GB ECC.

The specs posted above are by no means the minimum specs that you could use when running a validator, however you should be aware that if you are using less you may need to toggle some extra optimizations in order to be equal to other validators that are running the standard.

## Do I need to trust the validator to transfer my nomination rewards?
No, rewards are handled on protocol level.

## Do I earn less as a nominator?
You will earn the same as validators minus the nomination fee set by the validator you choose to nominate to.

## Do I need to keep my private keys on my validator?
No, you donâ€™t need to keep your private keys on your validator. And we strongly advise you not to.

## Can I add more stake to my validator while the staking period is in progress?
Yes. You can your stake by bonding more to your validator, this will effectively increase your stake.

## Can I stop my validator and unstake?
No. Your stake is locked for the pre-defined staking period, your stake is automatically returned to your address upon completion, together with the accumulated staking rewards.

## Can I stake coins that are not yet unlocked by my vesting schedule?
Yes. Locked coins can be staked on your own validator or nominated to an existing one.

## When should I receive my rewards for running a validator?
All validation/nomination rewards are credited in your selected destination address upon completion of the staking period determined in the process of adding a validator.

## Is my validating node uptime important?
Yes, the reward is directly correlated to your uptime.

## How can I check if my node is healthy and operational?
Simply select your node as an endpoint in Funan. Once you are connected to your node you can perform health checks through our UI
