# Governance Overview on Selendra

Selendra employs an on-chain governance system that allows token holders to participate in decision-making processes that shape the network's future. This guide explains how governance works on Selendra and how you can participate.

## What is On-Chain Governance?

On-chain governance refers to the process by which blockchain protocol changes are proposed, decided, and implemented directly through the blockchain itself rather than through off-chain methods. This creates a transparent, decentralized decision-making system.

## Why Governance Matters

Effective governance ensures that:

1. **Protocol Evolution**: The network can adapt and improve over time
2. **Decentralized Decision-Making**: No single entity controls the network's future
3. **Stakeholder Participation**: Those with a stake in the network have a voice
4. **Transparent Processes**: All decisions are made openly and verifiably

## Selendra's Governance Model

Selendra uses a sophisticated governance system with several components:

### 1. Proposals

Proposals are formal suggestions for changes to the Selendra network. They can include:

- **Runtime Upgrades**: Changes to the blockchain's core functionality
- **Treasury Spending**: Funding projects that benefit the ecosystem
- **Parameter Changes**: Adjustments to network parameters (like fee structures)
- **Major Token Burns**: Reduction of token supply through burning events

### 2. Voting

Token holders vote on proposals using their staked SEL tokens. The voting power is proportional to the amount staked and is handled in a stake-weighted system.

### 3. Council

Selendra has an elected council of representatives who:
- Can make emergency decisions
- Help filter and prioritize proposals
- Represent passive stakeholders who don't actively participate

### 4. Technical Committee

A group of technical experts who can fast-track urgent technical upgrades for security reasons.

## The Governance Process

The typical governance process follows these steps:

1. **Proposal Submission**:
   - Anyone can submit a proposal by depositing a minimum amount of SEL
   - Proposals enter a queue and are considered based on deposit size

2. **Discussion Period**:
   - Community discusses proposals in forums and social channels
   - Proposers may refine their proposals based on feedback

3. **Voting Period**:
   - Token holders cast votes during a defined period (typically 7 days)
   - Votes are weighted by stake amount

4. **Execution**:
   - If approved, proposals enter an enactment period
   - After the enactment period, the proposal is automatically implemented

## How to Participate in Governance

### Viewing Active Proposals

1. Go to the [Selendra Governance Dashboard](https://wallet.selendra.org/governance)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Browse active proposals, referenda, and council motions

### Voting on Proposals

1. Select the proposal you wish to vote on
2. Choose your vote: "Aye" (approve) or "Nay" (reject)
3. Select the amount of tokens to vote with
4. Confirm your transaction

### Creating a Proposal

Creating a proposal requires:

1. A clear objective and technical implementation
2. A minimum deposit of SEL tokens (returned if proposal passes)
3. Community discussion and support gathering before submission

For detailed instructions, see our [Creating Proposals Guide](./creating-proposals.md).

## Governance Parameters

Selendra's governance has several important parameters:

- **Minimum Deposit**: The minimum amount of SEL required to submit a proposal
- **Voting Period**: 7 days for standard referenda
- **Enactment Period**: 8 days after a proposal is approved
- **Approval Threshold**: Adaptive based on voter turnout and proposal type
- **Council Size**: 13 members with rotating elections

## Special Governance Features

### Conviction Voting

Selendra uses conviction voting, which allows you to multiply your voting power by locking your tokens for longer periods:

| Lock Period | Vote Multiplier |
|-------------|----------------|
| No lock     | 0.1x           |
| 1 week      | 1x             |
| 2 weeks     | 2x             |
| 4 weeks     | 3x             |
| 8 weeks     | 4x             |
| 16 weeks    | 5x             |
| 32 weeks    | 6x             |

### Adaptive Quorum Biasing

The threshold for proposal approval varies based on:
- Who proposed it (public or council)
- Voter turnout
- The type of change being proposed

This creates a balanced system that resists both centralization and pure majority rule.

## Governance Best Practices

To be an effective governance participant:

1. **Stay Informed**: Follow discussions in community channels
2. **Research Thoroughly**: Understand proposals before voting
3. **Consider Long-Term Impact**: Vote based on the network's long-term health
4. **Vote Regularly**: Active participation strengthens the ecosystem
5. **Delegate When Needed**: If you lack technical expertise on a proposal, consider following trusted community members

## Recent Governance Examples

- Runtime upgrade to version 1.6.0 implementing fee structure changes
- Treasury funding for developer tooling improvements
- Parameter adjustments for staking rewards distribution
- Scheduled token burn of 5% of treasury funds
