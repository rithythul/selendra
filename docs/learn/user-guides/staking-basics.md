# Staking Basics on Selendra

Staking is a core feature of Selendra's Proof-of-Stake consensus system. This guide explains what staking is, how it works on Selendra, and how you can participate.

## What is Staking?

Staking is the process of locking up your SEL tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards in return. When you stake your tokens, you're essentially putting them to work as part of Selendra's security mechanism.

## Why Stake Your SEL?

There are several benefits to staking your SEL tokens:

1. **Earn Rewards**: Receive regular staking rewards in the form of additional SEL tokens
2. **Support the Network**: Help secure and strengthen the Selendra network
3. **Participate in Governance**: Staked tokens can be used to vote on governance proposals
4. **Economic Sustainability**: Staking creates a more stable token economy by reducing circulating supply

## Staking Roles on Selendra

There are two main roles in Selendra's staking system:

### 1. Validators

Validators are network participants who run nodes that process transactions and produce blocks.

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 50,000 SEL tokens staked
- Running a validator node 24/7 with high reliability
- Technical knowledge to maintain secure and updated server infrastructure

**Rewards and Risks:**
- Higher rewards due to direct participation in consensus
- Risk of slashing (losing part of stake) if the validator misbehaves or has technical issues

### 2. Nominators (Delegators)

Nominators participate in staking by delegating their tokens to validators they trust.

**Requirements:**
- No minimum SEL token requirement (though higher amounts make delegation more effective)
- Need to select reliable validators to maximize rewards and minimize risks

**Rewards and Risks:**
- Earn a portion of rewards generated by validators you support
- Lower risk compared to running a validator, but still subject to slashing if your chosen validators misbehave

## How Staking Works on Selendra

1. **Token Inflation**: Selendra issues 21 million SEL tokens annually as inflation
2. **Reward Distribution**: These tokens are distributed to active validators and their nominators
3. **Validator Selection**: The staking system selects validators based on the total amount staked (their own stake plus nominations)
4. **Era System**: Rewards are calculated and distributed at the end of each era (24 hours on Selendra)

## How to Stake Your SEL Tokens

### As a Nominator (Recommended for Most Users)

1. **Prepare Your Wallet**:
   - Create a Selendra wallet (see our [Creating a Wallet](./creating-wallet.md) guide)
   - Transfer SEL tokens to your wallet

2. **Access the Staking Interface**:
   - Visit the [Selendra Staking Dashboard](https://wallet.selendra.org/staking)
   - Connect your wallet

3. **Select Validators**:
   - Research and choose validators with good performance records
   - Consider factors like commission rate, past performance, and self-stake amount
   - Nominate 5-16 validators for best results (your stake will be automatically allocated)

4. **Bond Your Tokens**:
   - Specify the amount of SEL you want to stake
   - Choose your rewards destination (add to stake or transfer to account)
   - Sign the transaction

5. **Start Earning Rewards**:
   - Your nominations become active at the next era
   - You'll start receiving rewards after your validators produce blocks
   - Rewards are distributed automatically at the end of each era

### Managing Your Stake

- **Check Rewards**: Monitor your staking rewards through the dashboard
- **Rebond or Withdraw**: Adjust your staked amount as needed
- **Change Validators**: Update your validator selections periodically based on performance

## Unbonding Period

When you decide to unstake your tokens, they enter an **unbonding period**:

- Default unbonding period: 28 days
- During this time, your tokens are locked and don't earn rewards
- This security measure prevents certain attacks against the network

## Staking Rewards Calculation

Staking rewards on Selendra are calculated based on:

1. **Total Staked**: The percentage of total SEL supply that is staked
2. **Validator Performance**: How well your validators perform their duties
3. **Commission Rate**: The percentage validators take from rewards before distribution to nominators
4. **Your Stake Proportion**: Your nomination as a percentage of total stake for your validators

## Staking Risks and Considerations

- **Slashing Risk**: If validators you've nominated act maliciously or experience technical problems, part of your stake may be slashed
- **Opportunity Cost**: Staked tokens are locked and can't be used for other purposes
- **Reward Variations**: Staking rewards can vary based on network conditions and validator performance
- **Unbonding Period**: Remember that unstaking requires a 28-day waiting period
