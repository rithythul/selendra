# Selendra Network Business Paper
v3.1

## Executive Summary

Selendra Network is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain built on Substrate with AlephBFT consensus and a Proof-of-Stake security model, designed to serve the growing digital economy in Southeast Asia, with a particular focus on Cambodia. With a 1-second block time and deterministic finality within 2-3 seconds, Selendra provides the performance necessary for enterprise and consumer applications while maintaining decentralization and security. The platform currently processes approximately 2,000-2,500 TPS for simple transfers, with a path to reach 5,000 TPS in optimal conditions and 10,000+ TPS through future optimizations.

Our mission is to deliver a user-centric blockchain platform that combines enterprise-grade security with intuitive interfaces, allowing businesses to tokenize assets and digitize operations while providing individuals with new financial tools and opportunities. Focusing on DeFi, Real World Assets (RWA), loyalty programs, and privacy features, Selendra creates a sustainable ecosystem supported by an annual inflation of 21 million SEL tokens and an innovative 50/30/20 fee distribution model.

**Cambodia First Strategy**: Our initial market focus is exclusively on Cambodia, serving as both our development hub and primary target market. By deeply embedding ourselves in the Cambodian economy first, we aim to create a proven model for blockchain adoption that can later expand across Southeast Asia. With blockchain adoption encouraged by the National Bank of Cambodia, we're partnering with local institutions to build an ecosystem that empowers communities and fosters cross-border innovation. This focused approach allows us to build tailored solutions for Cambodian enterprises, empower local developers, and onboard millions of Cambodian internet users to their first blockchain experience through practical, everyday applications.

## Market Opportunity

Southeast Asia represents one of the world's fastest-growing digital economies, with blockchain adoption accelerating across multiple sectors. Cambodia, with its 11+ million internet users but less than 5% crypto penetration, presents a significant growth opportunity. Key market drivers include:

## SEL Token Economy

The SEL token forms the foundation of the Selendra ecosystem with a history of strategic evolution:

### Historical Context

Selendra's tokenomics has evolved significantly since its inception:

- **Initial Design (2020)**: Started with a maximum supply of 3.14 billion SEL (2^32) as BEB20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain
- **Strategic Reset**: Most tokens on BSC were burned (except those owned by users) to transition to a more sustainable model
- **Bitcoin-Inspired Model**: Adopted a model inspired by Bitcoin's limited supply, with 210M initial supply and 21M annual inflation

### Current Model

- **Initial Supply**: 210 million SEL distributed strategically to bootstrap the network ecosystem
- **Annual Inflation**: 21 million SEL (10% of initial supply, decreasing in percentage terms over time)
- **Deflationary Mechanisms**:
  - Up to 50% of initial supply (105M tokens) may be burned through governance decisions
  - 50% of all transaction fees are burned
  - Governance-controlled burning adapts to market conditions and ecosystem needs
- **Fee Distribution**: 50% burned, 30% to validators, 20% to treasury
- **Utility Functions**:
  - Transaction fee payment
  - Staking for network security (50,000 SEL minimum validator stake)
  - Governance participation
  - Service discounts and premium features
