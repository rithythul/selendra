# History and Tokenomics of Selendra Network

## Origin and Motivation

Selendra Network began as a challenge by the KOOMPI team to deeply understand blockchain technology at a fundamental level. Thanks to the Substrate Framework developed by Parity Technologies and open-source projects like AlephBFT, the team was able to develop Selendra into what it is today. Throughout its lifespan, Selendra has undergone numerous iterations and network design shifts before settling on its current architecture as described in the whitepaper.

## Technical Evolution

As detailed in the whitepaper, Selendra has evolved into an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain built on Substrate with AlephBFT consensus and a Proof-of-Stake security model. This technical foundation enables Selendra to provide fast 1-second block times with deterministic finality within 2-3 seconds, processing approximately 2,000-2,500 TPS for simple transfers. The platform is designed to serve enterprise and individual users across Southeast Asia, with an initial emphasis on Cambodia.

## Tokenomics Evolution

### Initial Token Design (2020)

When Selendra first launched in 2020, the team wanted to gauge community response and set an initial maximum supply of 3.14 billion SEL (equivalent to 2^32), minted as BEB20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain. This initial token distribution served two key purposes:
1. Testing market response before Selendra's mainnet went live
2. Raising seed funding to help operate network nodes

### Transition to Elastic Tokenomics

After gaining experience and market feedback, the team recognized that an elastic tokenomics model with balanced inflation and deflation mechanisms would better serve the network's long-term sustainability. This led to a significant tokenomics redesign:

1. The team burned all tokens on BSC, except those already owned by users
2. Inspired by Bitcoin's limited supply of 21 million BTC, they established a new initial supply of 210 million SEL
3. They implemented a plan to potentially burn up to 50% of this supply through governance decisions
4. They established an annual inflation rate of 21 million SEL

### Current Tokenomics Model

As described in the whitepaper, Selendra's current tokenomics model combines predictable inflation with deflationary mechanisms:

1. **Initial Supply**: 210 million SEL tokens distributed strategically to bootstrap the network ecosystem, supporting early adopters, community airdrops, and providing security during the network's formative stages.

2. **Inflation**: A fixed rate issuing 21 million SEL annually (10% initial inflation rate that decreases in percentage terms as the total supply grows).

3. **Deflationary Mechanisms**:
   - Up to 50% of the initial supply (105 million tokens) may be burned through governance decisions as network adoption increases
   - Transaction fee model where 50% of all fees are burned, 30% go to validators, and 20% to the treasury
   - Governance-controlled burning mechanism that adapts to market conditions, user growth, and ecosystem needs

4. **Economic Balance**:
   - Provides sufficient initial supply to bootstrap network security and liquidity
   - Fixed inflation ensures predictable validator rewards independent of transaction volume
   - Combination of fee burning and governance-controlled supply reduction creates balance between rewarding participants and protecting token value

This evolved tokenomics design supports Selendra's goal of becoming Southeast Asia's leading blockchain infrastructure, creating an environment where validators receive sustainable rewards while users benefit from a currency designed to maintain long-term value.
