# Selendra Network Implementation Checklist

This document guides implementation priorities for Selendra Network, clearly distinguishing between essential work and features that should be deferred. The phases and priorities align with our technical architecture and whitepaper.

## Development Principles

- **Focus on Core Infrastructure**: Prioritize network stability, performance, and compatibility
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build foundational elements before specialized features
- **Developer Experience First**: Make it easy for developers to build on Selendra
- **Strategic Enterprise Features**: Implement only business features with proven demand

## MUST DO (Essential Priorities)

### Phase 1: Performance Foundation (0-6 Months)
- [x] Optimize AlephBFT consensus for 1-second block time
- [x] Implement Substrate staking mechanism with 50,000 SEL minimum
- [x] Develop EVM compatibility with gas estimation
- [ ] Build multi-chain and native wallet with SEL staking
- [ ] Scale transaction throughput from current 2,000-2,500 TPS to 5,000 TPS
  - [ ] Implement transaction validation pipelining
  - [ ] Optimize EVM execution environment
  - [ ] Enhance state storage access patterns
  - [ ] Implement parallel transaction processing for independent transactions
  - [ ] Optimize network message propagation
  - [ ] Optimize block structure for better parallelization
- [ ] Create comprehensive security audit framework
- [ ] Develop TPS benchmarking framework with realistic workloads
- [ ] Establish validator hardware recommendations and guidelines

### Phase 2: Scaling Infrastructure (6-12 Months)
- [ ] Ethereum bridge with robust security measures
- [ ] Basic DEX functionality for token swaps
- [ ] Lending protocol with over-collateralization
- [ ] Initial RWA framework for asset tokenization
- [ ] Implement zero-knowledge proof libraries (foundation only)
- [ ] Sharded transaction processing to enable linear scaling
- [ ] Speculative execution to hide latency during transaction processing
- [ ] Dedicated fast paths for validator consensus messages
- [ ] More efficient light clients through optimized state proofs

### Phase 3: Decentralization and Security (12-18 Months)
- [ ] Decentralized identity infrastructure for business use
- [ ] B2B middleware for enterprise system integration
- [ ] Research design patterns for privacy-preserving contract infrastructure
- [ ] Dynamic validator requirements adapting to network growth and token value
- [ ] Formal verification tools for runtime safety during upgrades
- [ ] More inclusive governance mechanisms through graduated voting rights
- [ ] Enhanced security features to protect validators from attacks

### Stablecoin Infrastructure
- [ ] Launch KHR-pegged stablecoin
- [ ] Develop merchant tools for accepting Digital KHR
- [ ] Build infrastructure for international settlements

### Phase 4: Privacy Technology (18-36 Months)
- [ ] Real estate tokenization platform (market opportunity)
- [ ] Zero-knowledge infrastructure for all privacy operations
- [ ] Confidential transaction implementation hiding financial data
- [ ] Private smart contracts enabling confidential business logic execution
- [ ] Regulatory compliance tools balancing privacy with legal requirements
- [ ] Fiat on/off ramps for Southeast Asian markets
- [ ] Enterprise-grade security compliance framework
- [ ] Implementation of basic private state management and shielded execution

### SEL Token Essentials
- [x] Implement 50/30/20 fee distribution (burn/validators/treasury)
- [x] Stake-weighted governance voting
- [ ] Transparent governance processes for token burning decisions
- [ ] Governance mechanisms for controlled supply reduction

### Key Success Metrics
- Enterprise partnerships with productive implementations
- Transaction volume through bridges and DEX
- SEL token utility metrics (staking percentage, active addresses)
- Transaction throughput milestones (2,000 → 3,500 → 5,000 → 10,000 TPS)
- Developer adoption rate (SDK downloads, GitHub activity)
- Number of deployed contracts and active dApps

## NOT NOW (Defer or Avoid)

### Phase 1 (Defer)
- No-code/low-code tools (complexity exceeds immediate value)
- Advanced governance modules (focus on basic governance first)
- Enterprise-specific dashboards (prioritize developer tools)
- Complex identity solutions (too early without core infrastructure)

### Phase 2 (Defer)
- Additional blockchain bridges beyond Ethereum (focus on one solid bridge)
- Advanced DEX features like order books and margin trading
- Algorithmic stablecoins (regulatory uncertainty)
- Privacy features beyond basic infrastructure (technical complexity)
- Supply chain finance platform (requires industry partnerships)

### Phase 3 (Defer)
- Social login and consumer identity (focus on business needs first)
- White-label loyalty programs (wait for proven demand)
- Complex cross-border settlement (regulatory hurdles)
- Full-scale private smart contracts (technology not mature)
- Multi-chain identity federation (excessive complexity)

### Phase 4 (Defer)
- GameFi and P2E ecosystem (not aligned with enterprise focus)
- Healthcare data solutions (regulatory complexity)
- Private DeFi protocols (premature without basic privacy)
- Cross-chain privacy (technical complexity)
- Advanced analytics platform (core functionality first)

### Future Considerations (Reconsider After Phase 4)
- Carbon credit marketplace (outside core competency)
- Cross-chain privacy (excessive technical complexity)
- Custom L2 scaling solutions (focus on L1 optimization)
- Generalized AI + blockchain integration (speculative value)

### Token Features (Defer)
- Complex token utility beyond core functions
- Specialized governance forums for different stakeholders
- Advanced loyalty program integration with SEL
- Token economics experimentation (maintain stability)
