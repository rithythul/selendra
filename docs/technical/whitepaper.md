    price_oracle: PriceOracle, // SEL/USD price feed
    base_fee_usd: f64,        // Target fee in USD
}

impl FeeCalculator {
    pub fn calculate_fee(&self, operation: Operation) -> Amount {
        // Get operation base cost
        let base_cost = operation.base_cost();
        
        // Apply network utilization multiplier
        let utilized_cost = if self.block_utilization > 0.8 {
            base_cost * (1.0 + (self.block_utilization - 0.8) * 5.0)
        } else {
            base_cost
        };
        
        // Convert USD to SEL
        let sel_amount = utilized_cost / self.price_oracle.get_price();
        
        // Round to nearest precision
        Amount::from_sel(sel_amount)
    }
}
```

2. **Dynamic Adjustment Parameters**
```rust
pub struct FeeAdjuster {
    // Target block utilization
    target_utilization: f64,   // Default 0.5 (50%)
    // Adjustment thresholds
    min_adjustment: f64,       // Minimum fee change (1%)
    max_adjustment: f64,       // Maximum fee change (100%)
    // Smoothing factor
    alpha: f64,               // EMA weight (0.1)
}

impl FeeAdjuster {
    pub fn calculate_adjustment(&self, metrics: NetworkMetrics) -> f64 {
        // Calculate utilization error
        let error = metrics.utilization - self.target_utilization;
        
        // Calculate adjustment factor
        let adjustment = error * self.alpha;
        
        // Clamp adjustment
        adjustment.clamp(-self.max_adjustment, self.max_adjustment)
    }
}
```

3. **Fee Types and Weights**
```rust
pub enum OperationType {
    Transfer(Amount),

    Identity(IdentityOp),
    CrossChain(BridgeOp),
    Enterprise(ApiOp),
}

impl OperationType {
    pub fn base_cost(&self) -> f64 {
        match self {
            Transfer(amount) => 0.0001,  // $0.0001 base
            SmartContract(op) => match op {
                Deploy => 0.005,     // $0.005 base
                Execute => 0.00005,  // $0.00005 base
                Store(size) => size as f64 * 0.000005, // $0.000005/KB
            },
            Identity(op) => match op {
                Basic => 0.005,    // $0.005 base
                Advanced => 0.025,  // $0.025 base
                Corporate => 0.05,  // $0.05 base
            },
            CrossChain(op) => match op {
                Bridge => 0.0025,   // $0.0025 base
                Message => 0.001,   // $0.001 base
                Transfer => 0.005,  // $0.005 base
            },
