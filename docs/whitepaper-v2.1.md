## 4. SEL Token Economics

### 4.1 Token Utility

The SEL token serves as the native utility token of the Selendra ecosystem, fulfilling multiple essential functions. It serves as the primary medium for transaction fee payment, compensating validators for processing network operations. Through staking, SEL tokens secure the network via Selendra's Proof-of-Stake mechanism, with stakeholders receiving rewards proportional to their contribution. Governance rights are extended to token holders, with voting power weighted based on the quantity and duration of tokens staked. The token also provides tiered fee discounts based on staking amounts, incentivizing long-term holding and network participation. Additionally, SEL plays a crucial role in supporting the confidential transaction infrastructure, powering privacy operations throughout the ecosystem.

### 4.2 Supply and Distribution

Selendra Network was initially launched in 2022, and since then, has undergone multiple iterations to optimize both technical infrastructure and tokenomics. From this point forward, Selendra implements a precise token supply model designed for long-term sustainability and balanced incentives.

The total token supply is fixed at 210 million SEL, with an annual inflation rate of 21 million SEL tokens to sustain network security and ecosystem growth. This controlled emission follows a structured allocation framework:

- 30% (63 million SEL) allocated to community and early adopters, rewarding those who contribute to network growth and adoption
- 30% (63 million SEL) allocated to the Selendra Foundation for ongoing network and ecosystem development
- 30% (63 million SEL) allocated for market liquidity, with 50% of this amount (31.5 million SEL) scheduled for burning after 5 years
- 10% (21 million SEL) reserved for Selendra's fundraising initiatives to ensure continued development

The fee structure is designed to balance network sustainability with validator incentives:
- 60% of all transaction fees are burned, creating deflationary pressure on supply
- 20% of fees are distributed to network validators as additional rewards beyond the inflation-based issuance
- 20% of fees are directed to the treasury to fund ongoing development and ecosystem initiatives

This tokenomic model creates a balanced system where validators are adequately incentivized, token supply inflation is offset by systematic burning, and sufficient resources are allocated to ecosystem development. The approach acknowledges both the need for token value preservation and the funding requirements of a growing network.

### 4.3 Staking Economics

Selendra's staking system forms the foundation of network security and validator incentives. Validator rewards compensate node operators for their role in block production and transaction validation, ensuring reliable network operation. The nomination mechanism allows token holders to delegate their SEL to validators they trust, participating in network security without running nodes themselves. To maintain honest behavior, slashing conditions impose penalties for malicious actions or operational failures, protecting the network from potential attacks. The reward distribution system follows a transparent schedule and mechanism, ensuring fair compensation for all participants based on their contributions to network security.

## 5. Governance Framework

### 5.1 On-chain Governance

Selendra implements a sophisticated governance system that enables decentralized decision-making while maintaining efficiency. The proposal mechanism provides a structured process for submitting and evaluating potential network changes, ensuring transparency and participation.
